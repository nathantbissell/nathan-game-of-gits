House Stark of Winterfell is led by the just Eddard "Ned" Stark, Lord of
Winterfell, Warden of the North, Hand of the King, Protector of the Realm,
Regent.  He would listen to the words of Renly Baratheon and allow him
to take the castle overnight by force, removing Geoffrey from the Iron Throne
and keeping the Baratheon's in power as they are the true heirs.
